feel free to email me for suggestionsa :)


things that I want to have implemented in the game:

idea No. 1)

create the window as a grid

idea No. 2)

when cursor hovers over brick, highlight the brick in white and have it flash.

idea No. 3)

make the floor breakable
- when block is HIT, break the block
- have particles that show the block broke
  
idea No. 4)
	BRAINSTORM sprite ideas
  create an actuall sprite (one that doesn't look like at hot dog)
  - maybe something 8-bit?
  
  
  
~~LONGTERM:

a changelog (*already made one*)

a patcher for Windows 10 + (and possibly windows xp and vista since TheGreatRambler has a 15 year old computer)

a website (*unconfirmed* / *most likely not happening*)

an inventory (*unconfirmed*)

character animation

a fully working procedural terrain generation (already done)

enemy and creature AI

species with life cycle (which falls into the enemy and creature AI catagory)

8-bit OR 16-bit game music inspired by some Breath of the Wild music (not sure how far I'll go with this since I have no idea how legal this would be to its fullest extent - DARN YOU NINTENDO)
