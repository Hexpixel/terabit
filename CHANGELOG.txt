Purpose of the CHANGELOG.txt:

- Terapixel uses the CHANGELOG to provide public documentation for people who want to know more about the game's version history and whatnot.

- The changelog includes many versions of the game that haven't yet been released  but will be released in the distant future.

- As of right now, every update beyond v0.0.0 is unconfirmed and is not set in stone.

General:

New Features:

Entitiy
- added the player entity.
