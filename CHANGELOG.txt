Purpose of the CHANGELOG.txt:

- Terapixel uses the CHANGELOG to provide public documentation for people who want to know more about the game's version history and whatnot.

- The changelog includes many versions of the game that haven't yet been released  but will be released in the distant future.

- As of right now, every update beyond v0.0.3 is unconfirmed and is not set in stone.


v0.0.0 -- (releasing on Monday 2/12/18)

General:

New Features:

Entitiy
- added the player entity.
- the player is currently very unstable.
- leaves a trail behind itself because I wasn't clearing the screen enough.

Terrain
- Terrian has been added in the game!
- When you launch the game, a random terrain will generate in the world.
- currently, you can't interact with the terrain (break blocks, build with blocks, etc.)
- more terrain features soon to come!

New Blocks
- no new blocks, other than the 'terrian block' which is just a placeholder for the terrain.
- you'll be seeing more blocks very soon, including a several colored grass blocks, different dirt blocks, and different stone blocks.
